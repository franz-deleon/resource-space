I had some trouble getting started with it too. I wasn't able to avoid some php programming to use it. First you need to prepare your XML defining the resources and metadata you are going to add, using the example in the plugin as a guide.
Next you need your XML in a string variable. Let's call it $xml_source. Finally you need to prepare an MD5 hash of the XML and your installation's scramble key. In my case the XML is in a file, $filename, and I proceed as follows:

$f = fopen( $filename, 'r');
$xml_source = fread($f,filesize($filename));
$md5r = md5($scramble_key . $xml_source);
?>
<FORM action="[your path to]/plugins/remoteimport/pages/update.php" method="POST">
<input type="hidden" name="xml" value="<?php echo $xml_source ?>">
<input type="hidden" name="sign" value="<?php echo $md5r ?>">
<input type="submit" name="submit" value="Import resources"/>
<p><?php echo $warn ?></p>
</FORM>

Clicking on "Import resources" calls the remote import plugin. You don't have to do it this way, but you need to pass it "xml" and "sign".
Hope this helps,

remote imports from an XML file?

A few people have asked me where the remote import plugin resides, so
I thought I would post it to the forum, where it may be of some use.

wwwroot/resourcespace/plugins/remoteimport

From the readme file: "There's no need to activate the plugin in Team
Centre because it's stand-along (it doesn't hook in to any existing
functionality)."

I don't feel qualified to offer any other advice as I haven't managed
to upload more than 35 records at  a time!

This plugin allows ResourceSpace metadata and files to be remotely created and updated.

It uses the following XML format:

<resourceset>
	<resource type="1">

		<keyfield ref="8">556677</keyfield>
		
		<field ref="18">My description of the picture</field>
		<field ref="3">Uganda</field>

		<collection>name of collection</collection> 

		<filename>/dir/dir/filename_of_image.jpg</filename>
	
	</resource>

	<resource type="1">

		<keyfield ref="8">556688</keyfield>
		
		<field ref="18">Example caption</field>
		<field ref="3">Mexico</field>

		<collection>name of collection</collection> 

		<filename>/somewhere/New Bitmap Image.bmp</filename>
		
	</resource>
</resourceset>


The "type" attribute of the resource tag specifies the resource type ID. This will be updated for existing resources.

The "Keyfield" tag specifies the key field used to find the resource and is the key field on the remote system being synchronised with (e.g. Record ID).

"Field" is the field to be updated, the "ref" attribute referring to the field numeric ID in System Setup.

"Filename" is optional and specifies a local file on the system to replace the existing resource file or add a file for new records.

There's no need to activate the plugin in Team Centre because it's stand-along (it doesn't hook in to any existing functionality).

Two paramaters most be POSTed to the script:

 - xml: the XML itself
 - sign: an MD5 hash of the installation's scramble key (from your config.php) concatenated with the above XML

The "sign" part ensures that this can only be used by someone that knows your system's secret scramble key, which is randomised for each installation as part of the automatic setup.

A note about fields. If you are updating a dropdown, checkbox, category tree or dyanamic keywords field (e.g. fixed metadata fields) then you must prefix the field value with a comma in the XML. This notifies the indexing built in to RS that it must index the entire field value as well as the individual keywords.
