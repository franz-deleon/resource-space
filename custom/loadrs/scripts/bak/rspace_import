What a fabulous application, and open source! Big thanks are owing to
Oxfam, the original developers and all the people who have contributed
to ResourceSpace. I hope the rest of us can help it grow!

Like many other people I need to put together a script to import a
batch of files into ResourceSpace along with metadata from a CSV.
Basically I'm hoping to write a PHP script that will do what the edit
and upload pages do, over and over for a batch of assets of various
types.

I've seen the examples on the forum, but as a complete newbie I'm
having trouble clarifying the basic steps an import script needs to
do. This is how it looks to me so far:

1. Read the first line of the CSV, which gives us the filename of the
first asset and its metadata.
2. Create a resource in ResourceSpace, giving it a temporary ref which
is the negative of the ref of the user doing the import. (So if I'm
user 2, give the resource ref -2).
3. Update the resource data for that asset using the data from the
CSV. (Assuming we've worked out the data mapping in advance.)
4. Copy the file into the ResourceSpace filestore.
5. Give the resource a "proper" resource ref.
6. Generate preview files, extracted text and keywords from the file
we've just copied in.
7. Loop back to next line of CSV.

Could some kind benefactor please give us any hints about which
functions we should call to do steps 2 to 6? If there's no function
that'll automatically create the right folder within /filestore to
store a new resource, what file structure should we use so the assets
are properly organised?

Thanks guys
